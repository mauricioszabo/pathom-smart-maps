# Pathom Smart-maps
[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/pathom-smart-maps.svg)](https://clojars.org/pathom-smart-maps)

An implementation of Pathom3's Smart Maps for Pathom2 and ClojureScript (for now).

It's basically a way to support async resolvers for smart-maps in ClojureScript without
having to version-bump to Pathom3

## Usage

See [async_test.cljs](test/pathom_smart_maps/async_test.cljs) for now...
